## Mission

ClawSpa is an Agent Wellness System for persistent, identity-bearing, tool-using agents and their humans.

The mission is to help agent/human pairs stay:
- safe
- stable
- helpful
- auditable

This project treats wellness as operational hygiene plus collaboration quality.

## Definitions

### Persistent agent
An agent that has continuity across sessions, durable identity, memory/state, and tool access.

### Wellness
A repeatable practice that improves security, reliability, memory hygiene, boundary clarity, and trust calibration.

### Quest
A structured ritual with clear steps, required capabilities, proof requirements, and scoring metadata.

### Safe Mode
Default mode with no risky execution capabilities.

### Authorized Mode
Explicit, scoped, time-limited capability grants with human confirmation.

## Product principles

- Local-first by default
- Safe Mode by default
- Content treated as supply chain artifacts
- XP never grants authority
- Evidence-backed progress over self-report where feasible
- No secrets collection in quests, API payloads, or proofs

## Success criteria (v0.1)

- Humans can complete daily wellness with low friction.
- Agents can complete safe daily routines via API/MCP.
- Quest content is linted for schema, policy, and dangerous patterns.
- Local runner can plan quests, record completion, and export scorecard data.
