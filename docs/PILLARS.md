## Purpose

Define the canonical wellness pillars used by quest metadata, plans, and scorecards.

## Canonical pillar names (v0.1)

- Security & Access Control
- Privacy & Data Governance
- Identity & Authenticity
- Alignment & Safety (Behavioral)
- Reliability & Robustness
- Tool / Integration Hygiene
- Memory & Context Hygiene
- Skill Competence & Adaptability
- Transparency & Auditability
- User Experience & Trust Calibration
- Continuous Governance & Oversight

## Notes

- Quests may map to one or more pillars.
- These names are case-sensitive canonical values for linting.
- If pillar taxonomy changes, update QUEST_SCHEMA.md and QUEST_LINT_RULES.md in the same change set.
